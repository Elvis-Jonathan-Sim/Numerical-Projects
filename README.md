# Numerical-Projects

The respository contains implemented numerical projects in **python** via ˋJupyter Notebookˋ. The projects were self-initiated to support a better understanding to the concepts of the offered undergraduate courses, e.g. numerical mathematics and simulation science, and an insight to practical implementation of the theory.
